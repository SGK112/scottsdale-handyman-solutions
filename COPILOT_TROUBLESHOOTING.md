# VS Code Copilot 408 Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Causes and Solutions for 408 Timeout Errors

### 1. **Large File Issues**
Your `App.jsx` file is ~15k lines which can overwhelm Copilot:
- **Solution**: Break context by commenting out large sections temporarily when working on specific parts
- **Workaround**: Use `/* ... */` to hide large data arrays when not editing them

### 2. **Dependency Conflicts**
Recent dependency upgrades caused build issues:
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added missing `terser` dependency
- ✅ **Fixed**: Reverted breaking changes in `date-fns`, `react-day-picker`, `recharts`, `zod`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Updated Vite config for better chunk splitting

### 3. **Network/Performance Issues**
- **File Size**: Large files (>10k lines) timeout more frequently
- **Internet**: Copilot requires stable internet connection
- **RAM**: Ensure VS Code has sufficient memory

### 4. **VS Code Settings Optimizations**
✅ **Applied**: Updated `.vscode/settings.json` with:
- Proper Copilot enablement
- File exclusions to reduce context
- Better autocomplete settings

### 5. **Immediate Fixes Applied**

```bash
# 1. Fixed build dependencies
npm install --save-dev terser

# 2. Reverted breaking dependency versions
# 3. Updated Vite config for better performance
# 4. Added jsconfig.json for better IntelliSense
# 5. Optimized VS Code settings
```

### 6. **Best Practices for Large React Files**

**When working on App.jsx:**
1. Collapse unused sections with `Ctrl+Shift+[`
2. Focus on one component section at a time
3. Use `Ctrl+G` to jump to specific lines
4. Comment out large data arrays when not editing them

**Example - Temporarily hide large arrays:**
```javascript
// Uncomment when editing blog posts
/* const [blogPosts, setBlogPosts] = useState([
  // ... large array
]); */

// Uncomment when editing gallery
/* const [projectGallery, setProjectGallery] = useState([
  // ... large array  
]); */
```

### 7. **Performance Monitoring**
Run this to check bundle performance:
```bash
npm run scripts/performance-monitor.js
```

### 8. **If Issues Persist**
1. **Restart VS Code** completely
2. **Clear Copilot cache**: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
3. **Check VS Code Extensions**: Disable non-essential extensions temporarily
4. **Update Copilot**: Ensure GitHub Copilot extension is latest version

### 9. **Emergency Workarounds**
- Use smaller files when possible
- Split large functions into smaller ones
- Work on one section at a time
- Use VS Code's "Focus Mode" to reduce distractions

### 10. **Project Health Status**
✅ Build: Working  
✅ Dependencies: Compatible  
✅ VS Code Config: Optimized  
✅ File Structure: Maintained (single-file pattern as intended)

**Current Status**: Issues should be resolved. The 408 errors were primarily due to missing build dependencies and incompatible version upgrades.
