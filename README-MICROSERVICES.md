# 🛠️ Scottsdale Handyman Solutions - Microservice Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

This project has been transformed from a monolithic 17,095-line React application into a modern microservice architecture for **maximum efficiency**. The separation provides better maintainability, security, scalability, and development workflow.
